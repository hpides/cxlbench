Recommendations:
    Hotspots: Start with Hotspots analysis to understand the efficiency of your algorithm.
     | Use Hotspots analysis to identify the most time consuming functions.
     | Drill down to see the time spent on every line of code.
    Memory Access: The Memory Bound metric is high  (95.2%). A significant fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and stores.
     | Use Memory Access analysis to measure metrics that can identify memory
     | access issues.
    Threading: There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (30.8%) in your application.
     |  Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in
     | your application.
